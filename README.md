# Coaching Website

The Coaching Website is a web application built with React, TailwindCSS, and Vite. The website was designed to promote coaching services. The original design was provided by the client, but some design choices were made to modernize and streamline the website. One notable feature that was added was a language switcher, implemented using i18n to allow for easy translation of the website's content.
